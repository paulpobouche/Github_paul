2016.09.26 - Nice work Paul. Your code is really well commented and easy
to follow, so that is good. You might try to make your documentation more
standardized, but this comes with practice. I think also that almost everyone
made the same mistake with p in HW2, so take a look at the correction to see
what I was going for. Your participation in class is great and you often seem 
to understand things well. If you want anything more challenging just let me
know!
