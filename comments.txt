2016.09.26 - Nice work Paul. Your code is really well commented and easy
to follow, so that is good. You might try to make your documentation more
standardized, but this comes with practice. I think also that almost everyone
made the same mistake with p in HW2, so take a look at the correction to see
what I was going for. Your participation in class is great and you often seem
to understand things well. If you want anything more challenging just let me
know!

2016.10.03 - Great work Paul. You seem like you're well ahead of the curve and
I get the impression you are helping some of your fellow students out. Thanks
for doing that, but be sure to use it as a learning opportunity for yourself:
can you explain to them how to do something, without giving them the answer?
In any case, keep up the good work and the comradery!
